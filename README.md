# RLjs

**RLjs** is based on a fork of
[reinforce](https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs). 

**RLjs** focuses on modularizing the original application with
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and rewriting the algorithms as a
learning process.

Currently, most work has been on TD-learning, a working app can be found on
https://rljs.herokuapp.com/#/gridworld-td, which is still very rough.

There is also another repo for hosting machine-learning related notebooks I
created when learning/implementing algorithms at
https://github.com/zyxue/sutton-barto-rl-exercises.
